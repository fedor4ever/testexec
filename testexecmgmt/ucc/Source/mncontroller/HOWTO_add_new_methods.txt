 --**-- HOWTO: Add new methods --**--

 This is just a quick note that describes how to add a new method to an existing service. 

 The problem is that once you've written a service, you've modified the CSvc class and 
 the CS class, so the code generator can't update these for you. So you have to do a
 couple of things manually - and this note is to make sure you don't miss something.

 (1) Add to the .x file and regenerate the basic files.

 (2) Add the signature to the CS.h file, put it in the correct order to keep things clean.

 (3) Add the implementation to the CS.cpp file. There is nothing much to remember here,
	 just make sure you return a normal value (call it rv) and everything is OK. 

 (4) Add a section to the instance keys.

 (5) Add a section to SetError().

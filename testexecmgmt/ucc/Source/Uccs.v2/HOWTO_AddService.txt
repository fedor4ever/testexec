 -- Adding Services to the UCCS --

1.	The rest assumes you have written some client class for the service. This client can have
	any arbitrary interface.
	
2.	Create a subdirectory and put all your service files in there.

3.	Add the rpcgen files, etc.

4.	Check that everything compiles and that you don't need to add libraries, include paths, etc.

5.	Create a new object to be the service interface object. This must inherit and implement
	the IService interface.
	
6.	Implement this class -- use existing classes as a guide.

7.	Add a new RPC Service ID.

8.	Add to the service table.

9.	Add startup / shutdown code to the service manager for this service.

 --**-- Quick reference guide for UCCS Commands (more for programmers) --**--


(2) UC_QUIT

Stops the script thread. It sets a flag which prevents the remote control from 
waiting on the rendezvous semaphore again (since it will block forever) and
signals the rendezvous semaphore to release it if that's where it is now. This
does not stop the use-case -- it will keep running until the device side runs
end use case. 


(3) UC_RUNCMD

Runs the command. Does lots of stuff.


(4) UC_ASSIGN

Adds the specified elements to the environment object. This is then used by the
parser in future commands.


(5) UC_WAITFOR

Waits for fields of the last reply to be at a certain value. It checks the value
of the fields, and if they are not equal then it goes back to the last runcmd
and runs all subsequent commands.

FIXME: need to check what happens if there haven't been any runcmd's yet -- both
in the case that this is the first command, and when this is not the first but
the previous are all non-runcmd


(6) UC_WAITFORSIGNAL

Waits for a signal from the device


(7) UC_RENDEZVOUS

Rendezvous with the device


(8) UC_REQUIRE

Require a field to be a particular value. If the field is not correct then this is equivalent
to a quit command.


(9)	UC_REQUIRENOT

Same as above however the logical not


(10) UC_CHECK

Checks that a field is a particular value. It differs from require in that if the condition
is not met, the script continues to run, however, a warning is output.


(11) UC_CHECKNOT

Logical not of the above operation.


(12) UC_PRINTENVIRONMENT

Prints out all the environment variables.


(13) UC_WAITFORNOT

Same as waitfor but not.


(14) UC_SIGNAL

Signal to device.
